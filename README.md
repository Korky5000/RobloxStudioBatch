# RobloxStudioBatch
Provides simple .bat templates that can be used to quickly edit Roblox places.

# Requirements
For the basic version that will open Studio with a specific PlaceID, you only need some version of Windows to run the .bat file

For the more advanced version that sets up VSCode and Rojo, you need Windows Powershell, Rojo, VSCode, and you should have "code" in your $PATH variable list to run VSCode from the .bat file. If you do not have "code" in your $PATH variable list, simply use the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH and you should be good to go.

It's worth noting that this will only work if you are logged into Studio and have access to the place file that you are attempting to edit.
